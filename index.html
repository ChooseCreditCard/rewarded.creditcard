      <h2>What Does “Being Rewarded” by a Card Actually Mean?</h2>
      <p>At a basic level, a reward card returns some value every time you spend: a percentage of the purchase price as cash-back, a number of points or miles, or access to perks like credits and discounts. The promise is that routine spending can generate a measurable benefit over time.</p>
      <p>However, not all spending is rewarded equally. Category rules, caps and exclusions shape which purchases generate the most value and which simply earn a minimal base rate. Understanding these patterns is key to choosing a card that rewards how you actually live, not just how it is advertised.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Purchases Turn Into Rewards Behind the Scenes</h2>
      <p>When a transaction settles on your account, the issuer reads the merchant category code and applies the earn rules in your card’s reward program. A grocery transaction might earn one rate, while flights, hotels or fuel earn another.</p>
      <p>Rewards are then credited to your balance according to the program’s schedule—sometimes instantly, sometimes on the statement date. Some issuers track separate balances for cash-back, transferable points and partner miles, each with different redemption options.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Welcome Bonuses, Promos and Ongoing Value</h2>
      <p>Welcome bonuses can make the first year with a card feel extremely rewarding, especially when the bonus is large relative to the required spend. Limited-time multipliers, seasonal promotions and referral bonuses can further boost short-term returns.</p>
      <p>Long-term value, however, depends on what happens after the initial offers expire. A card with modest ongoing earn rates but a big sign-up bonus may be less rewarding in the third or fourth year than a more balanced product with a strong long-term structure.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Redemptions: Where Rewards Become (or Lose) Value</h2>
      <p>Being rewarded is not just about how fast you earn, but also about how you redeem. Cash-back is typically straightforward, while points and miles can vary widely in value depending on whether you use them for statement credits, travel, upgrades or transfers.</p>
      <p>Some programs offer “sweet spots” where points unlock outsized value, while others quietly devalue over time through price changes or new restrictions. Paying attention to redemption options and program stability is just as important as chasing high earn rates.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Fees, Interest and the Net Reward Picture</h2>
      <p>Annual fees, supplementary card fees and FX surcharges all reduce the net value of what you earn. If you carry a balance and pay interest, the cost of borrowing almost always exceeds the value of any rewards accruing on new purchases.</p>
      <p>A truly rewarding setup is one where your estimated yearly rewards, including perks you actually use, comfortably exceed the total cost of holding the card—and where you are able to pay your statements in full and on time.</p>
